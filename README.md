# SimpleXML

Meant to be the simplest XML parser possible. 
This project was born after trying to get XStream to work within Karaf (OSGi framework).
I'm sure it's possible but after spending a day wrestling with linker errors I gave up.
And then decided to write my own XML parser.

This parser was easy to get to work because it has NO dependencies :)
